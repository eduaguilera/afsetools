# Irrigation Adjustment Factors

Adjustment factors for residue:product ratio and root:shoot ratio under
different water management regimes.

## Format

A data frame with columns:

- Water_regime:

  Water management (Irrigated, Rainfed, Mixed).

- Residue_ratio_factor:

  Multiplicative factor for residue:product ratio (irrigated crops have
  higher HI, so less residue).

- RS_ratio_factor:

  Multiplicative factor for root:shoot ratio (irrigated crops have
  shallower roots).

- Source:

  Literature source reference.
