These include nomenclatures, biomass coefficients, global warming
potentials, and other parameters needed for environmental footprint
calculations.

## Details

The data objects include:

- 35 nomenclature and classification objects

- 17 biomass coefficient objects

- 7 global warming potential objects

- 3 biological nitrogen fixation objects

- 6 constants and scalars

- Color palettes and utility vectors

For complete documentation of all data objects, see the
DATA_REFERENCE.md file in the package repository, or use `?object_name`
for specific objects after loading them with
