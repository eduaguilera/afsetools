\title{Calculate Crop Above-Ground Residue Biomass}
\usage{
calculate_crop_residues(Dataset, w_ipcc = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{Dataset}{Data frame with crop production data. Required columns:
\describe{
  \item{Name_biomass}{Crop name matching Biomass_coefs classification.}
  \item{Prod_ygpit_Mg}{Production in Mg fresh matter.}
  \item{Area_ygpit_ha}{Harvested area in hectares.}
  \item{Year}{Year of production (for modern variety adjustment).}
  \item{region_HANPP}{Region name matching Modern_variety_adoption.}
  \item{Water_regime}{One of "Irrigated", "Rainfed", or "Mixed".}
}}

\item{w_ipcc}{Numeric weight for the IPCC linear model in the ensemble
(0-1). Default 0.5. The Biomass_coefs ratio gets weight `1 - w_ipcc`.}
}
\value{
Data frame with added columns:
  \describe{
    \item{Prod_MgDM}{Product dry matter (Mg).}
    \item{Residue_MgDM}{Estimated above-ground residue dry matter (Mg).}
    \item{Yield_DM_Mgha}{Yield in Mg DM per hectare (intermediate).}
  }
}
\description{
Three estimation methods are combined:

1. **IPCC linear model** (IPCC 2019 Refinement, Vol.4, Ch.11, Table 11.1a):
   `AG_residue_DM = Slope * Yield_DM + Intercept`

2. **Biomass_coefs ratio model** (package default):
   `Residue_FM = Yield_FM * kg_residue_kg_product_FM`

3. **Modern variety adjustment** (Krausmann et al. 2013; Evenson & Gollin
   2003): Historical correction for pre-Green-Revolution varieties that had
   lower harvest index (more residue per unit product).

The final estimate is a weighted mean of methods 1 and 2, with irrigation
and variety-era adjustments applied.

\details{
Estimates crop residue (straw, stover, etc.) dry matter from yield data
using an ensemble of IPCC 2019 linear models, Biomass_coefs ratios, and
context-dependent adjustments for irrigation, N input, and modern variety
adoption.


**IPCC linear model**: For each crop mapped via `IPCC_crop_mapping`, the
per-hectare residue is estimated as:
`Residue_IPCC_Mgha = Slope_AG * Yield_DM_Mgha + Intercept_AG_MgDMha`
This captures the empirical finding (Lassaletta et al. 2014) that residue
production is not purely proportional to yield — there is a base structural
component (intercept).

**Irrigation adjustment**: Irrigated crops typically have higher harvest
index (Sadras 2007), meaning less residue per unit product. The adjustment
factor (default 0.90 for irrigated) is from the `Irrigation_adj` table.

**Modern variety correction**: Pre-Green-Revolution varieties had lower
harvest index. The `Modern_variety_adoption` table provides regional
time-series of `HI_correction_factor` (>1.0 for historical periods),
which multiplies the residue:product ratio.

**Ensemble**: The final residue estimate blends both methods:
`Residue_MgDM = w_ipcc * IPCC_estimate + (1 - w_ipcc) * ratio_estimate`

Requires these objects from `load_general_data()`:
- `Biomass_coefs` (with `Product_kgDM_kgFM`, `Residue_kgDM_kgFM`,
  `kg_residue_kg_product_FM`)
- `IPCC_residue_coefs`, `IPCC_crop_mapping`
- `Irrigation_adj`, `Modern_variety_adoption`
