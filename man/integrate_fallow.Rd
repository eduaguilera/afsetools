\title{Integrate Fallow Area into Cropland Area}
\usage{
integrate_fallow(x, .by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data frame with cropland and fallow area data containing columns:
LandUse, Name_biomass, Area_ygpit_ha}

\item{.by}{Character vector of column names for area aggregation grouping
(e.g., c("Year", "Region")). If NULL, no grouping is applied.}
}
\value{
Data frame with fallow area integrated into crop areas, excluding
  separate fallow entries. Includes Variable = "AreaProd" and Cat_1
  classification.
}
\description{
Integrates the area of fallow land into the area of crops by distributing
fallow area proportionally across herbaceous crops based on their area share.
}
\details{
This function:
1. Filters out non-cropland and fallow entries
2. Identifies herbaceous crops using Names_biomass and Names_cats
3. Calculates area share for each herbaceous crop within groups
4. Distributes fallow area proportionally to herbaceous crops
5. Adds Cat_1 classification from Names_cats

Requires these objects from load_general_data():
- Names_biomass (with Name_biomass, Name, Herb_Woody columns)
- Names_cats (with Name, Cat_1 columns)

Used in Crop_AreaNPP.R and Scenarios.R workflows.
