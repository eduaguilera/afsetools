\title{Load Color Palettes, Factor Levels, and Categorical Vectors}
\usage{
load_vectors(env = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{env}{Environment to load vectors into. Defaults to parent.frame().}
}
\value{
NULL (loads objects into specified environment)
}
\description{
Creates 300+ vector objects in the calling environment for data visualization
and analysis, including:
- Month-related vectors and dataframes
- Color palettes for different categories
- Factor level orderings
- Named color vectors for ggplot2 scale functions
- Categorical dataframes for NPP and C input categorization

This function is called internally by `load_general_data()` when
`load_vectors = TRUE`.
}
\details{
All vectors are created using assign() to ensure they are available in the
specified environment without needing to source external files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load vectors into current environment
load_vectors()

# Check what was loaded
ls()
}
