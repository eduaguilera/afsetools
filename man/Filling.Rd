\title{Fill gaps in time series}
\usage{
Filling(data, var, Index)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame (grouped if needed)}

\item{var}{Variable to be filled (unquoted column name)}

\item{Index}{Time index (usually year)}
}
\value{
Data frame with filled variable and source column indicating filling method
}
\description{
Fills gaps by linear interpolation when possible, or carrying
forward/backward when not possible. Labels output according to filling method.
}
\details{
Remember to use `group_by()` and `ungroup()` when needed (do NOT use `.by` with this function).
Always add `dplyr::ungroup()` immediately after using this function to prevent
grouped data from flowing downstream.

The function creates a Source_* column indicating:
- "Original": Value was present in original data
- "Linear interpolation": Value filled by linear interpolation
- "Last value carried forward": Value filled by carrying last known value forward
- "First value carried backwards": Value filled by carrying first known value backward
}

  group_by(Region, Item) |>
  Filling(Production, Year) |>
  ungroup()
}
